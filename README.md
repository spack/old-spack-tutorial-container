# Spack Tutorial Container

**This repository is how we used to build the Spack tutorial. It is no longer in use.**

This repository contains a container image you can use to do the
[Spack Tutorial](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).
It's exactly like the AWS images we use when we give the tutorial at
conferences.
